<p>Here is my github profile where I share my work around AI, Startups, and any other code that might be useful!</p>
 
 
Back in 2018/19 I worked with [Duncan](https://github.com/duncangrubbs) to build [BarterOut](https://github.com/BarterOut), a peer-to-peer textbook exchange platform! We are currently helping to build [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), the future data-infrastructure for VC!
